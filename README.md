Data and cleanning data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This project has:

* a tidy data set as described below, 
* a Github repository with our script for performing the analysis, and 
* a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that we performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
